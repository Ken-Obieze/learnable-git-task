## Version Control:

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, enabling you to recall specific versions later. It helps track and manage changes made by different contributors to a project, facilitating collaboration and providing a history of modifications.

## Git vs. GitHub:

**Git:**
Git is a distributed version control system.

**GitHub:**
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development projects using Git. It adds a collaborative and centralized online platform for sharing and collaborating on Git repositories.

## Three GitHub Alternatives:

1. GitLab
2. Bitbucket
3. SourceForge

## Git Fetch vs. Git Pull:

- `git fetch` retrieves changes from a remote repository but doesn't automatically merge them into your current branch. It updates your local knowledge of remote branches.
- `git pull` is a combination of `git fetch` and `git merge`. It fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

## Git Rebase:

Git rebase is a command used to integrate changes from one branch into another by applying each commit from the source branch onto the target branch. It results in a cleaner, linear project history.

Command for Git Rebase: `git rebase target_branch`

## Git Cherry-Pick:

Git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. It's useful when you want to pick and choose specific changes without merging entire branches.

Command for Git Cherry-Pick: `git cherry-pick commit_hash`
